# Price-Quality-Ratio-Selecting-Affordable-Quality
Repo for Price-Quality Ratio: Selecting Affordable Quality  Data Analysis Project.


Project Description:

The project "Price_Quality Ratio-Selecting Affordable Quality" aims to determine the best colleges based on a combination of their rank and tuition fee. By calculating the Price Quality ratio (Rank/Tuition Fee), the project identifies colleges with high and low quality price ratios. However, the project recognizes that this ratio alone does not provide a comprehensive assessment of college quality. To further evaluate the colleges, additional information such as the number of students who have passed, successfully found full-time employment, and the average pay for jobs is required. By considering these factors, the project aims to identify colleges with the best return on investment (ROI). While the Price_Quality Ratio provides some insights, it is not the sole determinant in evaluating the quality of colleges.
